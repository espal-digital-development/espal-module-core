# Espal Module Core

The core module builds on the base of the espal core. It is possible to run the core without this module, but it won't add any real overhead. Including is probably the most logical, but if you want to start something from pure scratch you leave it out.

More information can be found in the [espal-core documentation](https://github.com/espal-digital-development/espal-core).
